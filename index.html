    <p>A <b>laptop computer</b> or <b>notebook computer</b>,  also known as a laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">personal computer</span> (PC). Laptops typically have a <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);"> form factor</span> with a <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">flat panel screen</span> (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid and an <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">alphanumeric keyboard</span> and <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">pointing device</span> (such as a <span style="color: rgb(167, 135, 235);">trackpad</span> and/or <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">trackpoint</span>) on the inside of the lower lid, although <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">2-in-1 PCs</span> with a detachable <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">keyboard</span> are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".<span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">[1][2]</span> Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many laptops have a built-in <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">webcam</span> at the top of the screen and some modern ones even feature a <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">touch-screen</span> display. In most cases, unlike <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">tablet computers</span> which run on <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">mobile operating systems</span>, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems which have been traditionally associated with <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">desktop computers.</span></b></p>

    <p>Laptops run on both an <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">AC power supply</span> and a <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">rechargeable battery pack</span> and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">mobile use.[3]</span> Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">business trips</span>), in <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">education,</span> for <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">playing games, web browsing,</span> for personal <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">multimedia</span>, and for general <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">home computer</span> use.</p>
    <p>The names <b>"laptop"</b> and <b>"notebook"</b> refer to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (or on top of) the user's lap and can be used similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the terms <b>"laptop"</b> and <b>"notebook"</b> are used interchangeably;[4] in other <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">dialects of English</span>, one or the other may be preferred. Although the term <b>"notebook"</b> originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),[5] the term has come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.</p>
    <p>Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">desktop computer</span> into a single unit, including a display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (such as a touch pad or pointing stick). Most modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone, and many also have a touchscreen. Laptops can be powered by an internal <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">battery</span> or an external <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">power supply</span> by using an <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">AC adapter</span>. Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">price points</span>.</p>
    <p>Design elements, form factors, and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">rugged notebooks</span> for use in construction or <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">military applications</span>, as well as <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">low-production-cost</span> laptops such as those from the <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">One Laptop per Child</span> (OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">solar charging</span> and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">Portable computers</span>, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small <span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">niche market</span>, mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.<span style="color: rgb(135, 142, 235);">[6]</span></p>
